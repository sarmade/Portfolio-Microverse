# Portfolio Project

The Portfolio is simple: there’s no extraneous information, only basic background information, contact information, and a project showcase.
The Portfolio is: it use screenshots, mockups, live demos, and other visual tools to show the viewer what you’re capable of making.
The Portfolio is all thorough: while the design itself may be simple, they make use of links (both in-text and otherwise) to show extra background information about their work, projects, and history.
